## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Adding Custom Modules

The modular architecture makes it easy to extend functionality:

```python
# Example: Create custom_scanner.py
class CustomScanner:
    def __init__(self, url):
        self.url = url
    
    def custom_scan(self):
        # Your custom scanning logic
        return {"result": "data"}

# Import in main.py
from custom_scanner import CustomScanner

# Add to menu and integrate
```

### Automation with Scripts

```python
from web_analyzer import WebAnalyzer

# Automated scanning
targets = ["https://site1.com", "https://site2.com"]
for target in targets:
    analyzer = WebAnalyzer(target)
    result = analyzer.full_recon_scan()
    # Process results
```
